## 🔬 Technical Highlights

### Detection Algorithms

**1. Threshold-based**
```python
change_map = (|img2 - img1| > threshold)
+ Morphological filtering
+ Connected component analysis
```

**2. Otsu Auto-threshold**
```python
threshold = otsu_threshold(difference_image)
change_map = (difference > threshold)
+ Automatic optimal threshold
```

**3. Change Vector Detection**
```python
magnitude = √(Σ(band2 - band1)²)
change_map = (magnitude > threshold)
+ Multi-spectral analysis
```

**4. Vegetation Analysis**
```python
NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)
change = NDVI₂ - NDVI₁
vegetation_loss = (change < -0.1)
vegetation_gain = (change > +0.1)
```
